(Frank's take on Hestenes function models)

BASIC CLASSES OF MODELS:

1) Linear model:
* Rate of change = constant.
* Common representations are graphs and equations
for straight lines (e.g., velocity, acceleration,
force, momentum, energy).

2) Quadratic model:
* Change (in rate of change) = constant.
* Usual representations are graphs and equations for parabolas (e.g., accelerated motion, kinetic and elastic potential energy).

3) Exponential model:
* Rate of change is proportional to amount.
* Representations include graphs and equations of exponential growth and decay (e.g., population growth, radioactive decay).

4) Harmonic model:
* Change (in rate of change) is proportional to amount.
* Usual representations are graphs and equations of trigonometric functions (e.g., waves and vibrations, harmonic oscillators, situations in electricity and magnetism such as simple AC circuits and LC circuits).
